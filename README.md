As we all know, restaurants that refuse to split the check among diners in a party deserve to be publicly shamed for their anti-customer ways, in order that check-split-loving patrons have the information they need to take their business elsewhere.

Conversely, restaurants that do split the check deserve praise and repeat business.

This project builds a social-networking web site that:

    - allows users to "vote" on whether or not a restaurant splits the check
    - allows users to search for restaurants in the database, in order to find out if a particular establishment does or does not split the check
    restaurants are searchable by name and location
    - allows users to create a new listing for a restaurant if does not exist
